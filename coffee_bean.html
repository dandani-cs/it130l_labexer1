Herb Hyman moved roasting facility to Camarillo and began to establish direct relationships with coffee growers. History was made when a barista invented the ICE BLENDED® drink at our Westwood, California store. We opened our first store in the Philippines at 2003.

			<h3 style="color: #FEF6EB; font-family: arial; padding: 10px;"> <img src="starbucks-history.jpg" style="float:right; padding: 10px;" width="500" id="history"> <i> history </i> </h3>
			<p style="font-family: arial; text-align: justify; padding: 5px;"> The company was founded by <em>Herbert Hyman</em>  in September 1963, as a coffee service for offices. He and his wife Mona, whom he married in 1966, honeymooned in Sweden, where they discovered quality coffee. This sparked the decision to import, roast and sell gourmet coffee in Los Angeles, opening the first Coffee Bean store in 1968 in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Brentwood. Innovations included selling whole beans and touting their country of origin, and allowing customers to observe the beans being roasted and sample varieties before making a purchase. Hyman is considered to be instrumental in the creation of the gourmet coffee industry in the US. He died on April 28, 2014, at the age of 82. <br />

			By the 1970s, Coffee Bean had expanded to 10 stores in Southern California, and added exotic teas to the menu. In the summer of 1987, an employee brought a blender to a Westwood store, mixing together ice, coffee extract and chocolate powder, paving the way for the company's signature Ice Blended drinks. With the invention of the Ice Blended, the Coffee Bean saw a surge in popularity. The drink was a predecessor to the Starbucks Frappuccino. In 1991, when it was first planning to expand into Los Angeles, Starbucks tried to purchase Coffee Bean, but Hyman turned them down. The opening of Starbucks stores in Los Angeles unexpectedly helped Coffee Bean's business, by driving curious customers to the area. <br />

			In 1996, the Hymans sold the Asian franchise rights to Singaporean brothers Victor Sassoon and Sunny Sassoon. The Sassoons quickly expanded the company in the US and internationally, opening the first outlet in Singapore in 1996, and in Malaysia the following year. Within two years, they had opened 29 stores in Singapore and Malaysia, almost as many stores as the Hymans had opened in their 35 years of ownership. In 1998, the Sassoons, along with longtime friend Severin Wunderman, purchased the parent company, International Coffee & Tea LLC, from the Hymans, and took it global. Victor Sassoon works out of Singapore, Sunny Sassoon works in Los Angeles, and Wunderman is a silent partner with no role in management. International Coffee & Tea, LLC remains the name of the holding company. <br />

			Sunny Sassoon served as president and CEO from 1998 until 2008, when he moved to the executive chairman position. In 2008, Mel Elias (Sassoon's brother-in-law) assumed the role of president and CEO of the company, after spending seven years as chief operating officer. In September 2013, a significant equity position in Coffee Bean was acquired from International Coffee & Tea by US-based Advent International, in partnership with South Korea-based Mirae Asset Private Equity and Taiwan-based CDIB Capital. The Sassoon family remains a large shareholder. On September 3, 2015, John Fuller assumed the position of president and CEO. 

			On July 24, 2019, Jollibee Foods Corporation purchased The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf for $350 million.</p>

			<p style="font-family: arial; text-align: justify; padding: 5px;"> On 5 September 2012, Nokia announced a deal with Coffee Bean to offer wireless charging facilities in its cafés for customers who want to recharge their phones whilst on the go. On May 28, 2013, Hilton Worldwide announced they had signed an exclusive agreement for Coffee Bean to provide in-room coffee and tea for all Hilton hotels in North America, South America, and Central America. 

			Green Mountain Coffee Roasters announced on May 29, 2013, that they had partnered with Coffee Bean to create a K-Cup for Keurig single-cup brewing systems, available in the US as of 2014. On August 24, 2015, Coffee Bean announced they had signed an exclusive area development agreement with South Korean retail conglomerate E-LAND to enter into the Chinese market.<br /> <br />

			<blockquote> "Our philosophy of impacting lives from seed and leaf to cup is steeped in everything we do. By staying connected to the people for whom coffee and tea is a livelihood, we go beyond fair wages by giving back to the plantations, estates, and communities that grow our products by supporting their financial, educational, and medical needs. Cultivating these close ties benefits everyone; from the local growers to our global customers who get to taste the benefits of our partnerships." </blockquote>
